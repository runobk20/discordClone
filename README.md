### discordClone

Discord main page clone. Made with HTML, CSS, SASS and Javascript

This project help me learning to position images, working with layouts and using the Intersection Observer API to start the animatios when needed.

The use of JavaScript was simple, adding a mobile nav button that can be closed and also display a backdrop.
